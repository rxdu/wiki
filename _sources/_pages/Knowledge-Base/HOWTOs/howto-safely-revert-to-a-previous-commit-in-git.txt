How to Safely Revert to a Previous Commit in Git
================================================

[TO BE VERIFIED]

If you want to commit on top of the current HEAD with the exact state at a different commit, undoing all the intermediate commits, then you can use reset to create the correct state of the index to make the commit.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Reset the index to the desired tree
   $ git reset 56e05fced
   # Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
   $ git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
   $ git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"
   # Update working copy to reflect the new commit
   $ git reset --hard

### Open-source Software

**Communication**

* [Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM)](https://lcm-proj.github.io/)
> "LCM is a set of libraries and tools for message passing and data marshalling, targeted at real-time systems where high-bandwidth and low latency are critical."

* [Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa)
> "Libmraa is a C/C++ library with bindings to javascript & python to interface with the IO on Galileo, Edison & other platforms, with a structured and sane API where port names/numbering matches the board that you are on."

**Scientific Computing**

* [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
>"GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable."

**Operating Systems**

* [Xenomai](https://xenomai.org/)
> "Xenomai is about making various real-time operating system APIs available to Linux-based platforms. When the target Linux kernel cannot meet the requirements with respect to response time constraints, Xenomai can also supplement it for delivering stringent real-time guarantees."

**Programming Assitance**

* [Pantheios](http://www.pantheios.org/)
> "Pantheios is an Open Source C/C++ Diagnostic Logging API library, offering an optimal combination of 100% type-safety, efficiency, genericity and extensibility."

* [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)
> "Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools."
